# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Only the latest released App Store version of the app receives security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security problems.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting instead:
[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/vazonhub/centry-wallet/security/advisories/new)
— only the maintainers will see the report.

What to include:

- which data/features are affected;
- reproduction steps or a PoC;
- app version and platform.

You can expect an initial response within a few days. Once a fix ships, the
vulnerability is disclosed in an advisory crediting the reporter (unless you
prefer otherwise).

> Note: Centry stores all financial data locally on the device (SQLite + MMKV)
